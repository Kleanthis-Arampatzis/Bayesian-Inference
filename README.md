# Bayesian Inference
<p align="justify"> In the realm of data analysis and decision-making, Bayesian Inference stands as a powerful and versatile framework that enables us to confront uncertainty with a systematic and probabilistic approach. At its core, Bayesian Inference revolves around the idea of updating our beliefs in light of new evidence. Unlike traditional statistical methods that rely solely on observed data, Bayesian Inference seamlessly incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs, allowing us to refine our understanding as we gather more information. This methodological elegance grants us the ability to make informed decisions, forecast future events, and draw meaningful conclusions in the face of complex and ambiguous scenarios.  </p>

In the ever-evolving landscape of statistical modeling, the Bayesian Lasso emerges as a potent tool for simultaneously selecting relevant features and estimating their coefficients. Combining the elegance of Bayesian Inference with the sparsity-inducing properties of the Lasso, this technique provides a novel approach to tackling high-dimensional data and variable selection challenges.

<p align="justify">
The fundamental idea behind Bayesian Lasso lies in its ability to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. Unlike traditional linear regression, which often suffers from overfitting when the number of predictors greatly exceeds the sample size, the Bayesian Lasso employs a double-barreled strategy. It leverages the probabilistic framework of Bayesian Inference to incorporate prior information about the model parameters and introduces the Lasso penalty to encourage sparsity among the predictor variables.

This elegant fusion allows Bayesian Lasso to not only estimate coefficients for relevant predictors but also automatically identify and shrink irrelevant predictors to zero, effectively achieving variable selection as an integral part of the modeling process.

This repository contains two functions written in matlab that use Gibbs sample to implement the Lasso prior and the group Lasso prior as presented by (Casella et al. 2010).
